    <h3>Aloo baingan sabji is a delicious dish of potatoes and eggplants cooked in a spicy onion tomato </h3>
    <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large eggplant, cut into 2-inch chunks, or 8 to 10 baby eggplants</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder, optional</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander, chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps :</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Prepare the eggplants by washing, patting dry, and cutting into quarters.</li>
        <li>Soak the eggplant in warm water.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan, heat the cooking oil on a medium flame until it is hot.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds and fry them until they no longer splutter.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and fry them until they are slightly soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Then, add the diced eggplant and the potato cubes, stir and mix well. Sauté it for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, the red chili powder, and the chopped tomato. Stir to mix everything well and then sauté for another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle water on top of the vegetables and stir everything to mix well.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish and cook it until the vegetables are almost done. Check occasionally and stir to prevent burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>When nearly cooked, remove the cover from the dish and stir.</li>
        <li>Cook until both the potatoes and the eggplant are soft and cooked throughout. This is meant to be a dryish dish so cook off any extra water that may be present in it.</li>
        <li>When done, turn off the heat and then garnish with chopped, fresh coriander leaves. Serve with hot chapatis and a daal dish if you like. A spicy, tangy pickle also tastes great with this delicious subji. You can even add raita if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
